# Ingress

The objective of this lab is to expose the `web-frontend` service to the internet.

## The Ingress gateway

When you installed Istio, in addition to deploying istiod to Kubernetes, the installation also provisioned an Ingress Gateway.

View the corresponding Istio ingress gateway pod in the `istio-system` namespace.

```{.shell .language-shell}
kubectl get pod -n istio-system
```

A corresponding _LoadBalancer_ type service was also created:

```{.shell .language-shell}
kubectl get svc -n istio-system
```

Make a note of the external IP address for the load balancer.

Assign it to an environment variable.

```{.shell .language-shell}
GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

??? tip "A small investment"

    When the cloud shell connection is severed, or when opening a new terminal tab, `$GATEWAY_IP` will no longer be in scope.

    Ensure `GATEWAY_IP` is set each time we start a new shell:

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    cat << EOF >> ~/.bashrc

    export GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')

    EOF
    ```

In normal circumstances we associate this IP address with a hostname via DNS.
For the sake of simplicity, in this workshop we will use the gateway public IP address directly.

## Configuring ingress

Configuring ingress with Istio is performed in two parts:

1. Define a `Gateway` custom resource that governs the specific host, port, and protocol to expose
1. Specify how requests should be routed with a `VirtualService` custom resource.

### Create a Gateway resource

1. Review the following Gateway specification.

    !!! tldr "gateway.yaml"
        ```yaml linenums="1"
        --8<-- "ingress/gateway.yaml"
        ```

    Above, we specify the HTTP protocol, port 80, and a wildcard ("*") host matcher which ensures that HTTP requests using the load balancer IP address `$GATEWAY_IP` will match.

    The selector _istio: ingressgateway_ ensures that this gateway resource binds to the physical ingress gateway.

1. Apply the gateway resource to your cluster.

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml
    ```

1. Attempt an HTTP request in your browser to the gateway IP address.  It should return a 404 (not found).

### Create a VirtualService resource

1. Review the following VirtualService specification.

    ??? tldr "web-frontend-virtualservice.yaml"
        ```yaml linenums="1"
        --8<-- "ingress/web-frontend-virtualservice.yaml"
        ```

    Note how this specification references the name of the gateway ("frontend-gateway"), a matching host ("*"), and specifies a route for requests to be directed to the `web-frontend` service.

1. Apply the virtual service resource to your cluster.

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    kubectl apply -f web-frontend-virtualservice.yaml
    ```

1. List virtual services in the default namespace.

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    kubectl get virtualservice
    ```

    The output indicates that the virtual service named `web-frontend` is bound to the gateway, as well as any hostname that routes to the load balancer IP address.

Finally, verify that you can now access `web-frontend` from your web browser using the gateway IP address.

## Candidate follow-on exercises

We will not explore ingress any further in this workshop.  Consider the following as independent exercises:

- Creating a DNS A record for the gateway IP, and narrowing down the scope of the gateway to only match that hostname.
- [Configuring a TLS ingress gateway](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/secure-ingress/#configure-a-tls-ingress-gateway-for-a-single-host){target=_blank}
 

## Next

The application is now running and exposed on the internet.

In the next lab, we turn our attention to the observability features that are built in to Istio.
